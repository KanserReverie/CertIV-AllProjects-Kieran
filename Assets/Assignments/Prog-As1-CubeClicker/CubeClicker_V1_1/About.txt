26/03/21 - CubeClicker_V1.1-Kie-Prog-As1

Whipped this up on a long Friday night.

It does not have instantiating and would be helped with ".this". It had a good GDD but should have classes planned out better. It was all in cube and should have been in a separate class in a 2D array.

Made version 2 afterwards.

It has an interesting:
- Money system
- Colour changing system
- Slightly random velocity system linked to variables
- Crit /super lucky (%3) drop mutiplier / function
- Cube health constant regen
- Used "$$" for money ^_^
- Was going to break it into rows but this became too hard and needed full redoing
